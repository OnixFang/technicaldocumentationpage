        <p> JavaScript was introduced as a language for the client side. The development of Node.js has marked
          JavaScript as an emerging server-side technology too. However, as JavaScript code grows, it tends to get
          messier, making it difficult to maintain and reuse the code. Moreover, its failure to embrace the features
          of Object Orientation, strong type checking and compile-time error checks prevents JavaScript from
          succeeding at the enterprise level as a full-fledged server-side technology. TypeScript was presented to
          bridge this gap. </p>

      <article>
        <p>By definition, “TypeScript is JavaScript for application-scale development.”</p>
        <p>
          TypeScript is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language. It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg
          (designer of C#) at Microsoft. TypeScript is both a language and a set of tools. TypeScript is a typed
          superset of JavaScript compiled to JavaScript. In other words, TypeScript is JavaScript plus some additional
          features.

        <p>Typescript is an Open Source technology. It can run on any browser, any host, and any OS. You will need the
          following tools to write and test a Typescript program:</p>

        <h3>A Text Editor</h3>
        <p> The text editor helps you to write your source code. Examples of a few editors include Windows Notepad,
          Notepad++, Emacs, vim or vi, etc. Editors used may vary with Operating Systems. The source files are typically
          named with the extension .ts</p>

        <h3>The TypeScript Compiler</h3>
        <p>The TypeScript compiler is itself a .ts file compiled down to JavaScript (.js) file. The TSC (TypeScript
          Compiler) is a source-to-source compiler (transcompiler / transpiler).</p>

        <p>The TSC generates a JavaScript version of the .ts file passed to it. In other words, the TSC produces an
          equivalent JavaScript source code from the Typescript file given as an input to it. This process is termed as
          transpilation.</p>

        <p>However, the compiler rejects any raw JavaScript file passed to it. The compiler deals with only .ts or .d.ts
          files.</p>

        <h3>Node.js</h3>
        <p>Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side JavaScript. Node.js is required
          to run JavaScript without a browser support. It uses Google V8 JavaScript engine to execute code. You may
          download Node.js source code or a pre-built installer for your platform. Node is available here −
          https://nodejs.org/en/download.</p>

        <h2>Compile and Execute a TypeScript Program</h2>

      <article>
        <p>Let us see how to compile and execute a TypeScript program using Visual Studio Code. Follow the steps given
          below:</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1</strong> − Save the file with .ts extension. We shall save the file as Test.ts. The code
          editor marks errors in the code, if any, while you save it.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2</strong> − Right-click the TypeScript file under the Working Files option in VS Code’s Explore
          Pane. Select Open in Command Prompt option.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3</strong> − To compile the file use the following command on the terminal window.</p>

        <code>tsc Test.ts</code>

        <p><strong>Step 4</strong> − The file is compiled to Test.js. To run the program written, type the following in
          the terminal.</p>

        <code>node Test.js</code>

        <p><strong>Note</strong> − Multiple files can be compiled at once.</p>

        <code>tsc file1.ts, file2.ts, file3.ts</code>

        <p>The Type System represents the different types of values supported by the language. The Type System checks
          the validity of the supplied values, before they are stored or manipulated by the program. This ensures that
          the code behaves as expected. The Type System further allows for richer code hinting and automated
          documentation too.</p>

        <p>TypeScript provides data types as a part of its optional Type System. The data type classification is as
          given below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Any</strong>: the super tpe of all data types.</li>
          <li><strong>Built-in types</strong>: include number, string, boolean, void, null and undefined.</li>
          <li><strong>User-defined types</strong>: include Arrays, Enums, Classes, Interfaces, etc.</li>
        </ul>
